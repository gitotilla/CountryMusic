"Roll It Right or Roll On Out" (Upbeat, humorous)

(Verse 1)
You finish up the roll late at night,
And baby, it ain’t black or white,
There’s only one way it’s gotta go—
Over the top, or you’re out the door, you know.

(Chorus)
Roll it right or roll on out,
That little thing’s what I’m talkin’ ‘bout,
Put it wrong and we’re done, no pretend,
That’s the line where love meets its end.

(Verse 2)
Lights left on when you leave the room,
Closet, bathroom, you waste the gloom,
If you’re gonna leave ‘em shining bright,
Better pay that bill, it ain’t polite.

(Bridge)
And darling, if you wanna hear your tunes,
Headphones on, don’t make me swoon,
Country music's not for my ears,
Save those songs for your own front porch cheers.

(Chorus)
Roll it right or roll on out,
That little thing’s what I’m talkin’ ‘bout,
Put it wrong and we’re done, no pretend,
That’s the line where love meets its end.

(Outro)
Oh, and don’t wear my jeans or my shirts,
They’re mine and yours, let’s not get hurt,
Respect the little things that show you care,
Or baby, love won’t last you there.
